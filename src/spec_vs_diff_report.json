  "summary": "AuthGate was updated to reference a new versioned login image path and to render it with object-contain (no crop). However, the new image asset file itself was not added under frontend/public/assets/generated, and there are unrelated/speculative changes in metadata/summary files.",

      "reason": "The diff shows no new files added (ADDED FILES: none), so the required new static asset file is not present in the change set.",
